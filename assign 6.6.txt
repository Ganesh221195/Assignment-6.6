1)Explain the difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler


Fifo scheduler:
*The FIFO Scheduler places applications in a queue and runs them in the order of
submission
*The FIFO Scheduler has the merit of being simple to understand and not needing
any configuration, but it’s not suitable for shared clusters

Capacity scheduler:
*in capacity scheduler a separate dedicated queue allows the small job tostart as soon as it is submitted
*• Large job finishes late when compared with using the FIFO Scheduler

2)What are the limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x:



*utilization and job monitoring operations are monitored by job tracker in hadoop 1.x 
whereas in 2.x it is handled by splitting the task to resource manager,node manager
and the application manager.
*hadoop 1.x is Suited for maximum of 4000 nodes and 40000 tasks 
*hadoop 2.x can scale up to 10000 nodesand 100000 tasks
*hadoop 1.x Supports only MapReduce processing model
*hadoop 2.x also support other processing models other than map reduce model
